//! Server-side password hashing (A2a / SPEC Part 1.5).
//!
//! The server never sees a password. The client derives
//! `verifier = Argon2id(password, auth_salt)` and sends *that*; this module puts a second,
//! independent Argon2id over the verifier before it is stored, so a database dump alone does not
//! yield a login credential. `auth_salt` is public (the client must fetch it before it can log in);
//! the salt inside `password_hash` is per-user and random.
